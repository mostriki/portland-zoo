# _Animal List_

#### _An independent project exploring Angular in JavaScript, 10.27.2017_

#### By _Riki Montgomery_

## Description

_An animal tracking software application to allow zoo workers to track animals, record details about them, and assign caretakers to them._

## User Stories

* Extend the functionality of the app by building out the animal model to further enhance the app.

* Add custom SASS styling with corresponding Gulp tasks to compile.

* Display of the total number of caretakers needed in a day.

* Add a property that records when each animal was admitted. The user could enter a date and time, or the app can generate a timestamp.

* Expand the application to differentiate between animals' species. Group the animals into those categories. Then include a component to display the total needed caretakers for whichever species the user selects.

* Add a new master component to average the total age for each species.

* Show animals based on diet type. Then, show all animals who eat meat (carnivores AND omnivores)
